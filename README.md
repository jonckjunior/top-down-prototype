This is a 2d top-down roguelike shooter prototype that I did to test the godot engine.
Here are some of the features I added:
  - Player and guns/arms are de-coupled, so the arms can follow the mouse while the sprite stands still
  - Running animation / Idle Animation
  - Life, damage, reload speed modifiers
  - UI
  - Menus for pausing the game / Starting the game
  - Upgrade menu when the player levels up
  - Particles for shot, player damage, player death and enemy taking damage
  - Numbers are shown the enemy takes damage
  - Camera follows the player
  - Time is slown down for upgrades
